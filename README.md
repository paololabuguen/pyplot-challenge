# pyplot-challenge

In this challenge, we look at data of mice with tumors that are treated with different drug regimens and looking at different types of
plots we can do with the data. We also note down some interesting things we notice and wrote down some observations we see on the data.

Most of the code is written by me with some plotting code taken from solved lecture exercises as I was studying them for this challenge.
I also tweaked some exercises to include the random module like the part where we plot the final tumor volume for a mouse treated with Capomulin.
